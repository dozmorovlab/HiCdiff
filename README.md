# HiCdiff

## Overview 

`HiCdiff` provides functions for joint normalization and difference detection in multiple Hi-C datasets. `HiCdiff` operates on processed Hi-C data in the form of chromosome-specific chromatin interaction matrices. `HiCdiff` is available as an R package, the major releases can be found on Bioconductor (here)[insert URL]. 

`HiCdiff` accepts three-column tab-separated text files storing chromatin interaction matrices in a sparse matrix format which are available from several sources such as the [http://aidenlab.org/data.html](http://aidenlab.org/data.html) and [http://cooler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](http://cooler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). HiCdiff is designed to give the user the ability to perform a comparative analysis on the 3-Dimensional structure of the genomes of cells in different biological states. `HiCdiff` first can jointly normalize two Hi-C datasets to remove biases between them. Then it can detect signficant differences between the datsets using a genomic distance based permutation test. The novel concept of the MD plot, based on the commonly used MA plot or Bland-Altman plot is the basis for these methods. The log **M**inus is plotted on the y axis while the genomic **D**istance is plotted on the x axis. The MD plot allows for visualization of the differences between the Hi-C datasets. 

The main functions are:
+ `hic_loess()` which performs joint `loess` normalization on the Hi-C datasets
+ `hic_diff()` which performs the difference detection process to detect significant changes between Hi-C datasets and assist in comparative analysis

Several Hi-C datasets are also included in the package.


## Installation

To install `HiCdiff` from bioconductor open R and enter the following commands.

```
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("HiCdiff")
library(HiCdiff)
```


Or to install `HiCdiff` directly from the github release open R and enter the following commands.

```
library(devtools)
install_github('dozmorovlab/HiCdiff', build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(HiCdiff)
```


## Usage

First you will need to obtain some Hi-C data. Data is available from the sources listed in the overview along with many others. You will need to extract the data and read it into R as either a 3 column sparse upper triangular matrix or a 7 column BEDPE file. For more details on data extraction see the vignette included with `HiCdiff`.

Below is an example analysis using `HiCdiff`. The data in 3 column sparse upper triangular matrix format is loaded and the first step is to create a `hic.table` object using the `create.hic.table()` function. Next, the two Hi-C matrices are jointly normalized using the `hic_loess()` function. Finally, difference detection can be performed using the `hic_diff()` function. The `hic_loess()` and `hic_diff()` functions will also produce an MD plot for visualizing the differences between the datasets. 

```
# load data
library(HiCdiff)
data("HMEC.chr22")
data("NHEK.chr22")

# create the `hic.table` object
chr22.table = create.hic.table(HMEC.chr22, NHEK.chr22, chr = 'chr22')
head(chr22.table)

# Jointly normalize data for a single chromosome
hic.table = hic_loess(chr22.table, Plot = TRUE)
head(hic.table)

# input hic.table object into hic_diff
hic.table = hic_diff(hic.table, Plot = TRUE)
head(hic.table)
```

## Additional Vignettes

The `HiCdiff` paper included several supplemental files that showcase some of the usage and reasoning behind the methods. Below are the titles and brief descriptions of each of these vignettes along with links to the compiled `.pdf` and the source `.Rmd` files. 

**Normalization method comparison.** 

Comparison of several Hi-C normalization techniques to display the persistence of bias in individually normalized chromatin interaction matrices, and its effect on the detection of differential chromatin interactions.

**S2 File. Estimation of the IF power-law depencence.** 

Estimation of the power-law depencence between the $log_{10}-log_{10}$ interaction frequencies and distance between interacting regions. This vignette displays the reasoning behind using a power-law function for the simulation of the signal portion of Hi-C matrices.

**S3 File. Estimation of the SD power-law dependence.** 

Estimation of the power-law depencence between the $log_{10}-log_{10}$ SD of interaction frequencies and distance between interacting regions. This vignette displays the reasoning behind using a power-law function for the simulation of the noise component of Hi-C matrices.

**S4 File. Estimation of proportion of zeros.** 

Estimation of the depencence between the proportion of zeros and distance between interacting regions. This vignette shows distribution of zeros in real Hi-C data. The results were used for modeling the proportion of zeros in simulated Hi-C matrices with a linear function.

**S5 File. Evaluation of difference detection in simulated data.**
