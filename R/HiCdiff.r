#' HiCdiff
#'
#' HiCdiff provides functions for joint normalization and difference detection in multiple Hi-C datasets.
#' HiCdiff operates on processed Hi-C data in the form of chromosome-specific chromatin interaction matrices.
#' It accepts three-column tab-separated text files storing chromatin interaction matrices in a sparse matrix format
#' which are available from several sources. HiCdiff is designed to give the user the ability to perform a comparative
#' analysis on the 3-Dimensional structure of the genomes of cells in different biological states.
